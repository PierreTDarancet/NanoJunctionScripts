                 namelist. (AF)

19 Sep 2005      Missing lapack and blas routines added to Libs in order to make the 
                 WanT package self-contained (blas.f, lapack.f lapack2.f added), as
                 suggested by Paolo Giannozzi. Other portability issues due to the
                 different blas and lapack libraries addressed as in espresso: 
                 lapack_mkl.f lapack_ibm.f lapack_t3e.f added.

                 in Test3 and Test6. KnownBugs file updated. Added a workaround for a
                 XLF compiler bug making zmat_unitary to fail. Still a test version. (AF)

08 Sep 2005      Test3 properly working. (AF)

30 Ago 2005      Dimensions in Lamp changed for debug purposes, allocations in windows
                 updated. Large cleanup of unused variables and implicit conversions,

                 kgrid.f90 program added to utility. (AF) 

24 Ago 2005      Array out-of-bound in the interfaces to ZGESV (util.f90): fixed.
                 It is a reasonable cause for the weird errors involving zmat_unitary. (AF) 

12 Ago 2005      plot.x: plotting cell dimensions from input now in crystal units and
                 not as FFT mesh. locate_wf logical variable added in order to manage
                 whether shift WF's or not. Shift is now performed to a cell centered
                 in the center of the plotting cell. Test input files updated. 
                 Portability issues addressed for the shell scripts in the code. (AF)

11 Ago 2005      Plot.x: wannier functions are moved as close as possible to the 
                 origin before plotting for sake of simplicity. Output changed. (AF) 

10 Ago 2005      Plot.x now supports .txt format. Small changes in the code. Test8 
                 partly updated (plot). CRD format used to writes coordinates for plotting
                 substituted with XYZ fmt. For completeness reasons, CRD file is written
                 anyway as tmp file by gcube2plt and then removed. (AF)

08 Ago 2005      Remaining memory (missing deallocations) detected and solved (ions 
                 and trial_center_data modules) thanks to G95 compiler. Checks added 
                 during hamiltonian read in conductor.x: simply occurring errors 
                 avoided. Further hidden memory allocations by iotk detected and 
                 workarounded. (AF)

07 Ago 2005      Test3 changed: only valence WFs are computed, no disentangle is performed.
                 run.sh script output format (logs) changed; basedef.sh definition script
                 added to utility dir. (AF)

06 Ago 2005      envirnment.conf file in Tests updated with other internal environment
                 variable definitions: this avoid to repeat definitions in each tests
                 and allows some global setting to be better managed. run.sh scripts
                 accordingly simplified. check.sh script updated with verbosity level
                 managment. Output format of disentangle and wannier changed in order 
                 to simplify automatic check. Test references updated. (AF)

05 Ago 2005      Center weights for conditioned minimization implemented. Trial_center
                 type updated. IOTK updated to v1.0.0 . (AF)

                 subspace_init and localization_init respectively. Direct interface
                 between wannier and conductor implemented. Input files fmt changed;
                 tests updated. Internal format of *.ham file chenged in order to
                 include kpts and related weights. (AF) 

03 Ago 2005      Makefile system in Tests replaced by run.sh script system. 
                 Check script for test added in utility. (AF)

01 Ago 2005      configure.h added to Include dir in order to take trace of the
                 architecture / conpilation environment (experimental). Output format
                 chenged. Test running script (run.sh) changed (transport calculations
                 included in the "want" flags). (AF)

30 Jul 2005      As suggested by Giovanni Bussi (IOTK author) __IOTK_WORKAROUND7
                 may be join to  __IOTK_WORKAROUND3: new IOTK version imported and 
                 portability tested on INTEL compiler. (AF)

29 Jul 2005      Test3 updated to USPP. IOTK lib updated with a new version fixing
                 some bugs. convert_label.f90 moved from Libs to the module atomic.f90
                 in Modules. Bug fixed in plot.f90 in the FFT dimensioning of cwann 
                 array. Workaround for IOTK within INTEL compiler added: this fix
                 the bug giving runtime errors when reading/writing large integer
                 arrays. The workaround is switched on by the macro __IOTK_WORKAROUND7
                 in IOTK_lib/iotk_config.h .(AF)

28 Jul 2005      Reference dirs in tests updated. Test6 still missing. General cleaning
                 performed. (AF)

27 Jul 2005      Transport code simplified: greena.f90, greenb.f90 merged in green.f90;
                 the same for transporta.f90, transportb.f90 merged into 
                 transport.f90. Tests updated. (AF) 

                 Added two "print" lines in plot.f90 for the .gau output to ensure 
                 compatibility with the cube file format (MBN)

                 lattices. gcube2plt output changed and rightly flushed. (AF) 

05 Jul 2005      Plot and bands utilities updated with a small big fix: spin_component
                 flag in the input namelist is required. This should be only a 
                 temporary fix, better implementation ASAP. Fixed a bug in plot.x where
                 setting defaults for z FFT mesh. Test7 updated with plot calculation. (AF)

21 Jun 2005      Plot utility finally updated and tested. USPP not implemented but
                 for plotting purposes it seems to work anyway. Test2 and Test8

                 in order to deal with atomic starting centers. (AF)

06 May 2005      Test5 joint to Test2; other input changed; particularly, the 
                 unitary_thr parameters is no longer needed in any test (due to the bug
                 fix in Mkb calculation). (AF)

                 (AF)

16 Apr 2005      The same speedup procedure applied to zmatrix has been used for komegai.
                 In particular we adjusted some loops and introduce the use of BLAS for
                 a matrix triple product. Interface of komegai generalized in order to
                 account also for lambda_avg which has been eliminated from CVS. (AF) 

15 Apr 2005      Zmatrix routine found to be the most time consuming part in the
                 iteration loop of disentangle. Completely rewritten, time down of a factor
                 10 in test4 (but expected to be also better for large systems).
                 CM renamed as Mkb everywhere; disentangle loop changed in order to be
                 more readable. (AF)

04 Apr 2005      SP^3 hybrid centers added to trial_centers_setup routine; Y_lm
                 management changed (base routine added to sph_har_module) (AF)

03 Apr 2005      Internal representation of kpoint vector moved from crystal to cartesian
                 coordinates, in units of Bohr^-1. (AF)

01 Apr 2005      Mkb symmetrization performed. Some updates in bshells and util module.
                 README.input synchronized to the current input format.
                 Collinear spin polarization allowed in WanT calculation. Test7 added
                 in order to manage spin problems. (AF)

31 Mar 2005      Routine zmat_svd added to util_module. Direct use of lapack for SVD removed
                 from subspace_init and wannier. Wannier keeps on calling ZGEES for
                 schur factorization (maybe removable if the case). S^{-1/2}*A computed
                 by means of SVD and not directly in the beginning of wannier. Subspace_init
                 routine fully checked. (AF)

30 Mar 2005      PROJECTION and OVERLAP further tested, also on USPP. SUBSPACE_INIT
                 routine added to CVS. (AF)

29 Mar 2005      WFC_MANAGER completed within the new wfc treatment; wfc_info module
                 further updated; overlap tested; wfc_manager becomes a routine and
                 not a module. (AF)

28 Mar 2005      Global cleanup: GNU headers changed in source files giving copyright
                 to "WanT Group" instead of the list of all the people working to
                 the project. DOT_BLOCH routine and a non used copy of KINDS module
                 removed from LIBS. OVERLAP synchronized with the new implementation
                 of wfcs.

27 Mar 2005      WFC_INFO module updated and further tested. (AF)

26 Mar 2005      Type WFC moved to WFC_INFO and updated. WFC_MANAGER updated and
                 partially rewritten. Updates in Overlap and projections still missing.

25 Mar 2005      Instabilities found using MKL 7.2; solved using v6.1 . 
                 Starting hard changes in wfc data storage. TYPE WFC added, wfc_data
                 module, storing the data added. (AF)

24 Mar 2005      Important changes in the input format: 3 namelist instead of one,
                 variables renamed, input_parameters,f90 and input_base.f90 added;
                 many variables renamed through the code; intel compiler warning
                 on temporary array creation eliminated; references to all tests updated. 
                 (AF)

21 Mar 2005      DFT data filename written in output corrected. 
                 Timing modified in order to avoid initializations in derived types 
                 (not f90 std). PGI compatibility checked. (AF)

18 Mar 2005      Fixed a bug in ions.f90: different atomic species were not properly
                 treated. (AF)

15 Mar 2005      Fixed a bug in trial_center_setup routine. Added the input flag
                 unitary_thr both in want input and hamiltonian input in order to control
                 the checks on unitariery. (AF)

11 Mar 2005      Internal format of *.ovp file (overlap and projections) changed
                 in order to increase the readability. (AF)

27 Feb 2005      The bug in the IOTK lib evidenced by the use of G95 has been fixed.
                 Some optimization improvements in trial_center_setup when calculating
                 the phases and a major improvement in projection.f90 by inverting the
                 band and wannier function loops (the trial center setup calls have been
                 scaled by the number of bands). (AF)

26 Feb 2005      Module sph_har_module updated (bug fixed in the normalization of 
                 Y_22, Y2m2). Routine gauss1 renamed to sph_har_setup; f-spherical harmonics 
                 added to the module. IOTK updated to version 1.0.0test . A bug already 
                 present in the previous version with G95 is also present here.... (AF)

25 Feb 2005      G95 compilation tested. Trial_center_setup routine completed except
                 for the case of l = -1 (tetrahedron case, used e.g. for silicon). (AF)

21 Feb 2005      Some variables moved away from INPUT_MODULE to other data modules
                 (such as windows_module, subspace_module, kpoints_module) in order to
                 avoid circular dependencies. (AF)

18 Feb 2005      Projection routine started being re-written. Wfc_data renamed as
                 wfc_manager.f90. TRIAL_CENTER module containing definitions and 
                 subroutines for the trial_center type and TRIAL_CENTER_DATA module
                 added to Modules. File input_wan.f90 moved to input.f90. (AF)

17 Feb 2005      The gaussians used as trials for WFs are now defined with the pre-factor
                 |r|^l, i.e.   gauss(|r|) = r^l * e^{-(r/a)^2} . This is useful for 
                 the direct analytical calculation of their Fourier transform. (AF)

15 Feb 2005      Bugs fixed, new overlap procedure working and checked. (AF)

14 Feb 2005      gv_indexes routine moved from util_module to ggrids_module and improved.
                 set_overlap_map routine added. (AF) 

10 Feb 2005      Bug fixed in init_us_1 subroutine, USPP implementation is working. 
                 Test6 added (silicon USPP). Perl script added in utilities for CVS log
                 managing. (AF)

07 Feb 2005      Converters module updated with rank1 operations. Bugs fixed in
                 the USPP implementation. (AF)

06 Feb 2005      Undo of the below unification of augmentation routines.
                 We keep on using s_psi but a different augmentation routine for
                 overlap is used: add_us_overlap. This is for memory reason, 
                 in order to avoid the allocation of large workspaces. (AF)

05 Feb 2005      s_psi and sb_psi routines unified in augment_psi routine. (AF)

04 Feb 2005      Subtle bug in pw_export fixed. USPP are rightly initialized
                 (init_us_1 and init_us_2 + ccalbec). The augmentation routine
                 sb_psi added to repository. (AF)

03 Feb 2005      Wfc are now named evc everywhere (exept plot!) and their dimensions
                 are consistent with Espresso (npwkx for pw and no longer npwkx+1 as
                 was used in WanT before). Projection array (ca) is completely initialized
                 to zero. (AF)  

02 Feb 2005      init_us_2, ccalbec added in wfc_data in order to compute US basic
                 quantities. s_psi added in projections. (AF)

01 Feb 2005      Other routines imported from Espresso: sph_bes.f90, setqf.f90, 
                 allocate_nlpot.f90 . Nspin moved from kpoints_module to windows_module.
                 Variable allocation and init checked. init_us_2.f90, s_psi.f90 and
                 ccalbec.f90 added from Espresso. (AF)

31 Jan 2005      Pseudopotential routines from Espresso package imported in order 
                 to deal with USPP. Summary updated in order to describe the read PPs
                 (when they are). Added Test5 managing the calculation for the Gold
                 chain within USPP. Many old routines replaced with better versions
                 from Espresso. The g and gg (G vect in cartesian coord, their moduli) 
                 added to ggrid_module. Routines init_us_1.f90 and qvan2.f90 added.
                 (AF) 

30 Jan 2005      Few bugs fixed. (AF)

15 Jan 2005      GET_MONKPACK routine (compute the nk(:) and s(:) param of the 
                 Monkhorst-Pack grid from the input kpts) added and hamiltonian
                 input accordingly modified. Some other minor changes done. (AF)

14 Jan 2005      IOTK updated to v1.0.0beta4, including the workarounds for ifort and
                 pgi compilers. (AF) 

11 Jan 2005      Incompatibility of IOTK v.0.3.5 with MKL 7.0 libs detected. (AF)

29 Dec 2004      Hamiltonian output files now are all written in work_dir from input.
                 Iotk updated to 0.3.5 and test checked. Small bugs fixed. (AF) 

24 Dec 2004      windows_module.f90 moved to windows.f90. Routine 
                 widows_read_ext added, want_init updated. Fermi energy
                 data added to windows module (and added to pw_export).
                 MXDBND moved to NBND according to PWSCF. Plot.x not
                 yet completely synchronized but compiling. New implementation
                 of wfc started in module wfc.f90. Test references updated. (AF)

23 Dec 2004      Synchronizing HAMILTONIAN. Small bugs fixed. (AF)

19 Dec 2004      Tests updated. Bug fixing in PWEXPORT-WANT interface.
                 FMT changed in overlap_module IO. (AF)

18 Dec 2004      SUMMARY subroutine completed with Gaussian centers data. Bugs fixed in 
                 WFC_READ_EXT. PROJECTION subroutine updated. Bug fixed in 
                 WANNIER_CENTERS_INIT routine. Disentangle is completely IOTK working.
                 Tests updated and checked. (AF)

17 Dec 2004      Read subroutines for DFT data renamed to *_read_ext (in order to 
                 distinguish with the routines used in the internal IO). Some variables
                 renamed according to PWSCF notation (mxdgve -> npw; npwx -> npwkx; 
                 wtkpt -> wk). window.f90 code is obsolescent. Summary routine completed.
                 Ggrids reading routine done. genbtr, spline, splint routines removed 
                 from CVS because no longer used. ZGEMM and ZGESVD removed from CVS
                 because the code is supposed to be linked with BLAS and LAPACK.
                 WFC_DATA module (managing projection and overlap calculation) added. (AF)

16 Dec 2004      Ions module rewritten, PW_EXPORT fmt modified. Pseudopotential files
                 read from DFT data, want_init and summary updated. (AF)

15 Dec 2004      Want_init procedure completed and checked; summary module added;
                 some cleaning up around done in order to locate all writing on stdout
                 at the beginning in summary routine. Routine new_bshells.f90 moved to
                 bshells.f90. (AF) 

08 Dec 2004      Want_init procedure started; lattice_module updated. (AF)

07 Dec 2004      Utility module (util.f90) updated (routine zmat_hdiag
                 added ); bug fixing in disentangle; References for tests
                 updated. (AF)
                 Further simplifications in Hamiltonian; IOTK fmt started to be
                 be used in disentangle instead of the launch.dat binary file. (AF)

04 Dec 2004      Hamiltonian code updated and synchronized with the
                 new IO fmt of other codes. Internal and output FMT of
                 Hamiltonian changed (not yet completed). 
                 Cleanup and startup routines updated. (AF)

01 Dec 2004      Utilities module updated. (AF)

30 Nov 2004      Bug in the units of gaussians (disentangle) fixed. 
                 Overlap_extract routine added and tested (do not re-compute overlaps 
                 and projections but used the data produced by disentangle).
                 PWs and wfc managing erased from wannier procedure.
                 Onfly.dat, unitary.dat and landing.dat deleted. Other IOTK data files
                 added. (AF) 

28 Nov 2004      IOTK fmt used for the internal data files.
                 Kpoints data collected in a module (update).
                 Overlap, Subspace, Windows modules added. (AF)

25 Nov 2004      Fixed some portability bugs in the scripts: bash shell instead of
                 sh (thanks to Abinit guys). (AF)

20 Nov 2004      Severe bug in disentangle procedure fixed: nearest neighbor
                 shell indexes were crazy in some routines. Very often the
                 runtime execution was stable and only a minor error was produced;
                 some other times it was not. Wannier localization procedure is
                 usually poorly influenced by this change. (AF)

10 Nov 2004      Tests updated. Test1 and 2 renamed to 2 and 3; Test1 on bulk
                 silicon WFs added; Test4 about Al chains added. (AF) 
                 Various other updates in the test scripts.
