ABOUT WanT
==========================

WanT is an open-source, GNU General Public License suite of codes that provides an 
integrated approach for the study of coherent electronic transport in nanostructures. 
The core methodology combines state-of-the-art Density Functional Theory (DFT), 
plane-wave, norm-conserving pseudopotentials calculations with a Green's functions 
method based on the Landauer formalism to describe quantum conductance. The 
essential connection between the two, and a crucial step in the calculation, is 
the use of the maximally-localized Wannier function representation to 
introduce naturally the ground-state electronic structure into the lattice 
Green's function approach at the basis of the evaluation of the quantum conductance. 
Moreover, the knowledge of the Wannier functions of the system allows for the direct 
link between the electronic transport properties of the device with the nature of the 
chemical bonds, providing insight onto the mechanisms that govern electron flow at the 
nanoscale.

The WanT package operates, in principles, as a simple post-processing of any standard 
electronic structure code. In its present version (2.0.0) the user will find a 
wrapper to run WanT from the results of a self-consistent calculation done using the 
PWscf package (www.pwscf.org).


==========================
WanT FEATURES
==========================

WanT calculations will provide the user with:
- Quantum conductance spectrum for a bulk (infinite, periodic) system and for a
  lead-conductor-lead geometry
- Density of states spectrum in the conductor region
- Centers and spreads of the maximally-localized Wannier functions of the system

New features of version 2.0.0:
- complete code restyling (number of executable, internal data representation, repository)
- new iotk (XML-like) interface with quantum-ESPRESSO package
- new user interface (input file formats and calculation steps)
- test suite enlarged and improved
- important performance issues addressed (e.g. different scaling for large systems)
- improved numerical stability and machine portability
- implementation of ultra-soft pseudopotentials in the calculation of Wannier functions and
  related quantities
- implementation of "conditioned" localization and penalty functionals in 
  Wannier minimization
- implementation of k-point summations in transport calculations
- upgraded postprocessing suite (e.g. supported fmts in plot.x) and enlarged
