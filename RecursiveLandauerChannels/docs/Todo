  List of needed changes
*************************************

* plot.x: USPP features not fully implemented.

* disentangle + wannier: 
     - wfc stored in a k-indip array (waste small mem but
       increase performance)
     - scalar products in projections and overlaps by BLAS
               
* eigenchannel in transport calculation
* direct calculation of current

* coherent units everywhere (bohr and bohr^-1)
