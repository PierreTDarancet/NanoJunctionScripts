 List of the known bugs
****************************************


* INTEL ifort 8.1 (and previous versions) 
  IOTK library is not properly working on large integer arrays.
  When the array dimension overcomes a given threshold IOTK
  scan (and sometimes write) gives an error.
  This is a well known bug of the intel compiler.
  Setting __IOTK_WORKAROUND3 in iotk_config.h file (IOTK_lib)
  allows to run the code anyway, but should be further and largerly 
  tested.

* During recover (restart) procedure, but even in
  ordinary calculations, unitary checks fail without any clear reason.
  It happens on a IBM SP5 machine.
  It seems to be a bug of the XLF IBM compiler badly managing
  array dimensions through moduli and assumed shape interfaces.
  A workaround is under test. Results are correct anyway, since
  the failure involves only a check during the calculation: therefore
  it is possible to comment the checks (at the end of Libs/subspace_init.f90
  and Libs/localization_init.f90) to run the calculation anyway.

* In transport calculations, spikes lowering the conductance 
  of some units may appear. They are very often due to a 
  slight numerical misalignment of the electronic structure
  in the lead-conductor-lead system.
