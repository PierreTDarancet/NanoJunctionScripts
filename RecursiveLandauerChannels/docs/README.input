CARD 
WANNIER_CENTERS ( "crystal" | "angstrom" | "bohr" )

Aside the tag WANNIER_CENTERS, units for positions maybe specified:
"crystal"  : relative coordinates on the basis of a1,a2,a3 lattice vector (default)
"bohr"     : cartesian coordinates in bohr
"angstrom" : cartesian coordinates in angstrom

Next the card contains DIMWANN lines giving the trial centers for the WFs. 
Depending on the <TYPE> flag at the beginning of the line, 
formats are different.


<TYPE> may assume the values:  "1gauss", "2gauss", "atomic"

IF ( TYPE == "1gauss" ) THEN
   1gauss      x  y  z      l  m           rloc   [weight]
ENDIF

IF ( TYPE == "2gauss" ) THEN
   2gauss      x  y  z      xx  yy  zz     rloc   [weight]
ENDIF

IF ( TYPE == "atomic" ) THEN
   atomic     iatom  l m   [weight] 
ENDIF


TYPE == "1gauss", 
------------------------
This center is given by a single gaussian set at a given position with a given
angular momentum. Standard positions are usually atomic sites or bond midpoints.

   x,y,z    REAL
            define the position of the trial function. Units maybe specified aside
            the tag WANNIER_CENTERS: see above for more details.

   l, m     INTEGER
            are the angular momentum quantum numbers for the spherical harmonics
            giving the angular part of the trial WF. l can be set equal to 0, 1, or 2, 
            (and m values are then as usual) for standard spherical harmonics or l == -1
            indicate the sp^3 geometry. Here spherical harmonics are the real ones:
            l == -1:   m = -4 -->   1, 1,-1 dir  
                       m = -3 -->   1,-1, 1 dir 
                       m = -2 -->  -1, 1, 1 dir 
                       m = -1 -->  -1,-1,-1 dir 
                       m =  1 -->   1, 1, 1 dir 
                       m =  2 -->   1,-1,-1 dir
                       m =  3 -->  -1, 1,-1 dir
                       m =  4 -->  -1,-1, 1 dir
            l == 0 :   m =  0 -->  no problem
            l == 1 :   m = -1 -->  x 
                       m =  0 -->  z 
                       m =  1 -->  y 
            l == 2 :   m = -2 -->  x^2 - y^2
                       m = -1 -->  xz
                       m =  0 -->  3z^2 - r^2
                       m =  1 -->  yz
                       m =  2 -->  xy 
          
   rloc     REAL
            specifies the spread of the gaussian used for the radial part of the 
            trial WF. Units are bohr for both "bohr" and "crystal" and angstrom for 
            "angstrom" specifier.

   weight   REAL
            this value is required when conditioned minimization is performed. In case, 
            it should be in the interval [0, 1] ans weights the relative importance of 
            each center in the penalty functional. weight = 0 is used to switch off the
            constrain for a given center.  


TYPE == "2gauss" 
------------------------
The trial function is given as the difference between gaussians with s-symmetry placed
at positions selected by the user. This is useful to mimic a antibonding state.

   x,y,z    REAL
            as before for TYPE == "1gauss"
     
 xx,yy,zz   REAL
            as before for x,y,z for the units, specify the center of a second gaussian 
            used to build up the trial WF. This second case could be useful to describe
            anti-bonding WF.

  rloc      REAL
            as before for TYPE == "1gauss"

  weight    REAL
            as before for TYPE == "1gauss"
        
          
TYPE == "atomic" 
------------------------
Atomic (pseudo)-orbitals from pseudopotential files are used as trial functions. They are 
specified by the atomic index and the required angular momentum quantum numbers.

   iatom    INTEGER
            the index of the chosen atom.  

   l, m     INTEGER
            as before for TYPE == "1gauss" for a detailed description.

   weight   REAL
            as before for TYPE == "1gauss"

use_overlap    LOGICAL
            If .TRUE. reads the overlap matrices from file, otherwise basis orthonormality
            is assumed (which is by definition the case of Wannier functions)
            DEFAULT : .FALSE.

use_correlation   LOGICAL
            If .TRUE. correlation correction are read from file and included in the 
            calculation. See also the datafile_sgm variable.

            only when correlation is included in the calculation.
            DEFAULT : mandatory if use_correlation == .TRUE.


CARD <HAMILTONIAN_DATA>

This card is mandatory and specifies the details about hamiltonian blocks to be 
used in transport calculation. It includes a variable number of subtags (XML format)
to be used in the order shown below. The name and the number of these subcards 
depend on the calculation_type variable:

       if ( calculation_type == "bulk")      --> two subcards are needed
                                                 <H00_C>, <H_CR>
       if ( calculation_type == "conductor") --> seven subcards are needed
                                                 <H00_C>, <H_CR>, <H_LC>,
                                                 <H00_L>, <H01_L>,
                                                 <H00_R>, <H01_R>
each subcard (tag) may contain a number of attribute according to the format 
(XML compilant):

<Hwhatever cols="" rows="" />

cols (rows)   STRING 
              The string describing which index should be considered to define 
              the columns (rows) of the specific H submatrix. The format in the 
              is quite standard, according e.g. to the default for printing programs:
              "1-3,5,7-9" stands for "1,2,3,5,7,8,9", and so on. The string "ALL"
              is allowed as well, being equivalent to "1-Nmax".
              DEFAULT : "ALL"
