=====================================================================

In the current directory it is possible to find more documentation
about the theory and the usage of Wannier functions for transport
calculations, as implemented in the WanT code.

Files in the directory:

README.doc          the current file
want_manual.pdf     the WanT Manual file. It is also possible to generate
                    the pdf file directly from the tex sources in tex/
                    using the reported Makefile.

                    Note that only want_manual.tex file should be compiled,
                    while all the other tex sources are simply included 
                    in the main file.

README.input        the file explaining how to set an input file for Wannier 
                    post-processing and transport calculations

README.install      the file containing the instructions to configure and 
                    compile the code.

KnownBugs           the file containing the list of the known bugs

Todo                the file containing the list of needed changes

tex                 the directory containing the tex sources and the Makefile 
                    to generate the pdf file of the manual
