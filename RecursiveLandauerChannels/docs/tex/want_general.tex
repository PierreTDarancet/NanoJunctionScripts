\noindent {\bf CREDITS.} The development and  maintenance of the
\WANT\ code is promoted by the National Research Center on
nanoStructures and bioSystems at Surfaces (S3) of the Italian
INFM-CNR (http://www.s3.infm.it) and the Physics Department North
Carolina State University (NCSU) (http://ermes.physics.ncsu.edu)
under the coordination of Arrigo Calzolari, Andrea Ferretti  and
Marco Buongiorno Nardelli.\\

\noindent The present release of the \WANT\ package has been
realized by Andrea Ferretti (S3), Arrigo Calzolari (S3) and Marco
Buongiorno Nardelli (NCSU).

\noindent A list of contributors includes Carlo Cavazzoni
(CINECA), Benedetta Bonferroni (S3) and Nicola Marzari (MIT). \\

\noindent The routines for the calculation of the
maximally-localized Wannier functions were originally written by
Nicola Marzari and David Vanderbilt (\copyright 1997);  Ivo Souza,
Nicola Marzari and David Vanderbilt (\copyright 2002); Arrigo
Calzolari, Nicola Marzari, and Marco Buongiorno Nardelli (\copyright 2003).\\

conductance were originally written by Marco Buongiorno Nardelli
(\copyright 1998); Arrigo Calzolari, Nicola Marzari, and

\noindent {\bf GENERAL DESCRIPTION.} \WANT\ is an open-source, GNU
General Public License suite of codes that provides an integrated
approach for the study of coherent electronic transport in
nanostructures. The core methodology combines state-of-the-art
Density Functional Theory (DFT), plane-waves, pseudopotential
calculations with a Green's functions method based on the Landauer
formalism to describe quantum conductance. The essential
connection between the two, and a crucial step in the calculation,
is the use of the maximally-localized Wannier function
representation to introduce naturally the ground-state electronic
structure into the lattice Green's function approach at the basis
of the evaluation of the quantum conductance. Moreover, the
knowledge of Wannier functions allows for a
direct link between the electronic transport properties of the
device with the nature of the chemical bonds, providing insight
into the mechanisms that govern electron flow at the nanoscale.\\

\noindent The \WANT\ package operates, in principles, as a simple
post-processing of any standard electronic structure code. In its
present version \WANTVERSION\ the user will find a wrapper to run
\WANT\ from the results of a self-consistent calculation done
using the \PWSCF package (\PWSCFURL).\\

\noindent \WANT\ capabilities include:
- Quantum conductance spectrum for a bulk (infinite, periodic)
system and for a lead-conductor-lead geometry - Density of states
spectrum projected on the conductor region - Centers and spreads of the
maximally-localized Wannier functions of the system.\\
